*Case studies in successfully shipping Python software*

As developers, we spend our days with code. The site you're reading

This document is an always-growing list of **{TOTAL_COUNT}**
open-source Python applications arranged by topic, with links to
repositories, docs, and more. If you have one to add or find some
